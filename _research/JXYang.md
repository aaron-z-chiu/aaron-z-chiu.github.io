The PF-CFD (Phase-Field Computational Fluid Dynamics) Team is led by Prof. Junxiang Yang, an assistant professor at M.U.S.T. The team aims to develop high-performance mathematical models and computational algorithms in science and engineering.

Here, Qiu has been participating in 2 research projects, his researches are mainly focused on **Biological Modeling & Simulation** and **Phase-field Method**.
