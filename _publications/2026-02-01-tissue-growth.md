This paper presents a novel numerical framework for modeling curvature-dependent tissue growth on complex scaffolds. It is currently Under Review at *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (CMAME)*.

**Main Contributions:**
* Developed a proprietary C++ simulation framework from the ground up, implementing a novel Implicit ADI scheme to overcome the stability bottlenecks of traditional explicit methods. 
* Achieved second-order temporal accuracy, enabling high-fidelity long-term simulations that were previously infeasible.
* Extended the theoretical model from 2D surfaces to 3D volumetric geometries, enabling precise prediction of tissue evolution in realistic porous structures.
