This paper presents a three-dimensional multi-phase-field vesicles model and discusses its practical finite difference solver. It is currently under review at Computer Physics Communications (CPC).

**Main Contributions:**
* Implemented a hybrid numerical solver for 3D fluid vesicle dynamics in C++, integrating phase-field models into an existing simulation framework.
* Applied a semi-implicit finite difference scheme to evolve phase-field equations, ensuring rigorous numerical stability and energy conservation.
* Optimized memory management and data storage strategies, significantly reducing computational overhead for multi-vesicle interaction simulations.
