Research Experience
======

### [Research Group of Prof. Victor Junqiu Wei](https://zecqiu.com/research/JQWei)
*Research Assistant (Mar. 2025 – Present)*

Focused on **Conversational Text-to-Trajectory Visualization (Text2Traj)** using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Spatial Databases.
* **System Development:** Developed a dialogue-centric visualization system on **PostgreSQL** and **PostGIS**, integrating Text-to-SQL paradigms to process complex spatio-temporal queries.
* **Semantic Reasoning:** Implemented an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer to autonomously detect and resolve query ambiguities (e.g., spatial granularity conflicts, underspecified visualization types) and identify unanswerable requests.
* **Benchmark Construction:** Constructed a large-scale benchmark dataset containing adversarial examples to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in handling spatial constraints and administrative boundary logic.

*This work was selected for presentation at the seminar with Visiting Prof. [Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/){:target="_blank"} (HKUST).*

### [PF-CFD Team (Prof. Junxiang Yang)](https://zecqiu.com/research/JXYang)
*Research Assistant (Feb. 2024 – Present)*

Focused on **Multi-Phase-Field Vesicle Simulation** and **Biological Modeling** using Numerical Methods.
* **Numerical Solver Implementation:** Implemented a hybrid numerical solver for 3D fluid vesicle dynamics in **C++**, integrating phase-field models into an existing simulation framework.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Applied a semi-implicit finite difference scheme to evolve phase-field equations, ensuring rigorous numerical stability and energy conservation.
* **3D Tissue Growth Simulation:** Developed a 3D numerical simulation framework using **C++** and **MATLAB** to model curvature-dependent tissue growth on complex bio-scaffolds.
* **Solver Enhancement:** Engineered an **Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)** solver with second-order temporal accuracy to ensure unconditional numerical stability.
